        <span class="lead">OB Montessori Center (OBMC) Philippines is a premier educational institution dedicated to nurturing confident, competent, and compassionate learners. Founded by Dr. Maria Montessori’s principles and introduced to the Philippines by Dr. Preciosa S. Soliven, OBMC has grown into one of the country’s leading schools for Montessori education.

For decades, OBMC has provided a learning environment that values independence, character formation, academic excellence, and real-world readiness. Our classrooms are designed to spark curiosity, creativity, and a genuine love for learning. Students are given opportunities to explore, lead, and grow at their own pace while being guided by well-trained Montessori mentors.

OBMC is more than just a school—it's a community. We believe in creating a safe, respectful, and supportive space where students feel they belong, where they discover their strengths, and where they develop the confidence to take on bigger challenges. With strong values, innovative programs, and a commitment to global citizenship, OBMC helps shape students who are prepared not only for higher learning but for life itself.

Across all our campuses in the Philippines, OBMC remains faithful to its mission:
to cultivate disciplined minds, courageous hearts, and empowered individuals who make a positive impact in their communities.</span>
